# Proof of Concept Simulation - Agent-based modeling  

This simulation is part of the seminar "Computational Modeling of Social Systems" by Prof Garcia at the University of Konstanz.  

The simulation is based on the paper "Stress-testing the resilience of the Austrian
healthcare system using agent-based simulation" by Kalter, Lasser et al.

The associated demo data is a copy of the data provided in their github repositors under:

The simulation only serves as a proof of concept of a more sophisticated patient redistribution mechanism. 
As it uses randomly generated data for simplification. 
For Experiment Tracking a Weights&Biases account is needed.
